# findmytribe

**findmytribe** is a community tool built for developers and tech communities. It displays an interactive map showing the locations of all community members, along with their Twitter and Discord handles. Access is protected via a community code, ensuring only verified members can view or join the map.

Community managers also get access to a secure admin dashboard for managing members.
